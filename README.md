# 8-Week-SQL-Challenge
SQL is a highly sought after skill in the data analysis world and what better way to learn SQL than through a case study. That is what my data mentor and <a href="https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/">8 Week SQL Challenge</a> creator Danny Ma thought as well. Not only has he created the 8 Week Challenge, he is also the creator of the <a href="https://www.datawithdanny.com/">Serious SQL</a> course as well.

The challenge is meant to help students of SQL like myself learn SQL and all it can do via case studies. Most companies when hiring are looking for people with the SQL skill set already but getting the skills outside of either work or a course is difficult. 

Over the next few weeks I will look to solve the business problems the ficticious companies are having in the case studies.
